    <h3>Game Info</h3>
    <p>Description: The objective of this game is to defeat your opponent (the AI).</p>
    <p>This game is similar to games like Bejeweled. Both you and the AI have a base to protect, and the AI will begin sending troops to defeat your base.</p>
    <p>You have a table full of various colored icons that you must move into rows/columns of 3, 4, or 5 that, when matched, will spawn your own troops to defend yourself.</p>
    <p>Spawn enough troops to defeat the AI's base!!!</p>

    <p><b>Genre:</b> Puzzle</p>
    <p><b>Platform:</b> Desktop App</p>
    <p><b>Story:</b> Nothing really big here, mainly just this enemy guy wants to take over your country, so you gotta take his.</p>
    <p><b>Graphic Style:</b> 2D art with a similar aesthetic to that of "Puzzle Quest"</p>
    <p>
        <b>Gameplay:</b> You and the AI have a base HP bar that goes down as troops get within range of them. Melee troops spawn from 3-of-a-kind moves, ranges troops spawn from 4-of-a-kind moves,<br>
        and massive slow-moving tanks spawn from 5-of-a-kind moves.

        <h3>The Development Process</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            My original plan for this project was to make a sort of tug-of-war game versus an AI that utilized a match-3
            mechanic. This idea was inspired by an old fanmade arcade game mode I used to play a lot in the game known
            as Starcraft, where matching items in a grid spawns troops that would attack the enemy base.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I first began developing this game, my first goal was to get the grid and shapes spawning correctly.
            This first step was not difficult, as I formatted my code similar to how in-class exercises formatted it,
            which I found to be convenient and easy to read. The part that took me the longest here was creating shapes
            with more than 4 sides, such as the pentagon and hexagon, as PIXI does not have a function to create these,
            so I had to make my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I had everything displaying properly, my next task was to create my grid, a 2D array (array of
            columns). Each shape object contains a reference to their adjacent shapes, and every time a match is made,
            new shapes would be created at the beginning of each column in the grid. This part took a lot of work, as it
            took a bit to get the shapes' adjacent references to update correctly after each match.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to making the shapes fall, I utilized simple vector physics. Each shape would only react to
            physics, however, after a successful match was made, and each shape would stop falling when colliding with
            the one below them. Looking back at it, I believe there is a much more reliable way to make the falling
            mechanic work better. Each shape has their x and y position, but they also have 2 other variables called
            gridX and gridY, which determine the location of the grid space assigned to them. I should have made it so
            shapes would fall into their assigned grid positions rather than have them check their collision with other
            shapes, which can be less reliable. It certainly would have saved me a bit of time, the collision mechanics
            tended to get in my way a lot when I was developing the player's dragging interaction with the shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developing the match checking and potential match checking algorithms were where I had the most fun doing
            this project. These functions required a lot of if statements, as one can imagine, so I spent a lot of time
            thinking about how best to reduce the amout of statements necessary to get the job done. The feeling of
            getting these two functions to work 100% properly felt amazing, especially considering that I didn't spand
            very long on these compared to previous developments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, nearing the end of the project, I had to cut the troop spawning mechanic and settled with the
            goal of getting as high of a score as possible before running out of moves. In the future, however, I really
            want to implement this idea, as I believe it could make for a very fun interactive gameplay aspect.

        <h3>Project Requirements Outline</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This project does not use any sprite images. I drew everything using the GPU. The game is 100% functional,
            there were a total of 9 classes created and used (7 of them being particular shape types that inherited from
            my parent Shape class). I believe the game's design is pleasing, as the gameplay is set to one side o the
            screen while the feedback is set to the other side (score and game over text).
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal favorite aspect of the design, however, is the audio. I created all the original sound effects
            using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called FL Studio. It has a lot of useful features for creating and
            recording sounds, music, etc.

            NOTE: I have unique sounds for pretty much everything, including up to 7 different sound effects for
            collateral matches, and sounds for 4-matches and 5-matches!
        </p>
        <p>
            Concerning code conventions, there is no redundancy in my code that hasn't been put into a separate
            function. Everything is commented, so there should be no problems traversing through it.
        </p>
